pmtm_import.py is a Python script which can read in PMTM files and save them into the database.

It consists of three files:
 > pmtm_import.py - the main application, reads in a file and then saves it to the database.
 > pmtm_reader.py - contains the code to read in the PMTM file and set a load of fields to be equal to the data read.
 > pmtm_sql.py    - contains the code to take the data read in with pmtm_reader.py and save it to the database using MySQLdb library.

Setup:
 > Edit the Connection class in pmtm_sql.py to point your SQL Database with the correct username and password (this assumes you have created a database called "Ichnaea" to store the results.
 > Edit pmtm_import.py to direct PmtmStoreDirectory to the folder you wish to store a copy of results to.

Tests:
 > pmtm_read_tests.py - tests that the script can read in all the different version of PMTM ouput files.

To run:

  ./pmtm_import.py <PMTM file name>

Options:

  -d/--debug    prints debug information on run
  -x/--dry-run  reads file and checks data but doesn't save to database
